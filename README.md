# How to Run This App



# How to complete this project?

[x] 1. Review the Feed Reader Testing [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/3442558598/rubric)
[x] 2. Take the JavaScript Testing [course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud549)
[x] 3. Download the [required project assets](http://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader).
[x] 4. Review the functionality of the application within your browser.
[x] 5. Explore the application's HTML (**./index.html**), CSS (**./css/style.css**) and JavaScript (**./js/app.js**) to gain an understanding of how it works.
[x] 6. Explore the Jasmine spec file in **./jasmine/spec/feedreader.js** and review the [Jasmine documentation](http://jasmine.github.io).
[x] 7. Edit the `allFeeds` variable in **./js/app.js** to make the provided test fail and see how Jasmine visualizes this failure in your application.
[x] 8. Return the `allFeeds` variable to a passing state.
[ ] 9. Write a test that loops through each feed in the `allFeeds` object and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.
[ ] 10. Write a test that loops through each feed in the `allFeeds` object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.
[x] 11. Write a new test suite named `"The menu"`.
[ ] 12. Write a test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default. You'll have to analyze the HTML and the CSS to determine how we're performing the hiding/showing of the menu element.
[ ] 13. Write a test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked. This test should have two expectations: does the menu display when clicked and does it hide when clicked again.
[x] 14. Write a test suite named `"Initial Entries"`.
[ ] 15. Write a test that ensures when the `loadFeed` function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single `.entry` element within the `.feed` container.
[x] 16. Write a test suite named `"New Feed Selection"`.
[ ] 17. Write a test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the `loadFeed` function that the content actually changes.
[ ] 18. No test should be dependent on the results of another.
[ ] 19. Callbacks should be used to ensure that feeds are loaded before they are tested.
[ ] 20. Implement error handling for undefined variables and out-of-bound array access.
[ ] 21. When complete - all of your tests should pass.
[ ] 22. Write a README file detailing all steps required to successfully run the application.
